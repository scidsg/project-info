# Case Study: Hush Line

_A Cross‑Industry, Open‑Source Whistleblower Management System For Organizations and Individuals_

A whistleblower is an insider to an organization who exposes evidence of wrongdoing to authorities or the press with the intention of reforming it [1]. Not just an activity for exposing National Security secrets, whistleblowing can help make schools safer, businesses more compliant and ethical, and journalists more informed.

Disclosing secrets is vitally important and simultaneously one of the most dangerous things an individual can do, especially in the context of government and national security secrets. People who leak information often go into it without a plan, leading to exile, imprisonment, and even death. To protect against the discovery of someone leaking documents, many tools available today offer Tor‑only solutions—meaning the tools they use to upload documents are only accessible through special software providing anonymizing connections to the internet. While an essential piece of the puzzle, requiring someone to download software that could make them look suspicious as the only way to share information is a non‑starter, especially for people in countries where internet freedoms are restricted.

But what about the students who need to have a safe way to report information to educators about school safety, teacher misconduct, or struggles at home? Or the businesses that need methods for employees to report information that could lead to legal liabilities, including SEC violations or other lawsuits, without risking their careers and livelihoods? Or journalists who need an easy and safe way to receive information without requiring the public to learn a new esoteric technology?

In this paper, we'll see how Hush Line can meet all threat models, from nation‑states to neighborhoods, by providing a product suite that is both usable by non‑technical individuals and also highly resilient to censorship and surveillance.

## The Problems We're Solving

### Journalism  
It's not unique to Journalism, but from 2008 through 2020, there was a 26% decrease in newsroom headcount, totaling about 30,000 employees [5]. With changing budgets, tools requiring significant people‑time, training, and maintenance are hard to justify. Hush Line delivers end‑to‑end encrypted messages directly in your inbox so you don't have to download another app.

### Education  
A 16‑year study of one school showed that implementing physical security measures decreased the feeling of safety, increased peer violence, and quadrupled calls to police [6]. Students will only report if they trust confidentiality. Hush Line offers that trust.

### Business  
Up to 90% of women in the restaurant industry experience harassment, yet fewer than 1 in 3 file a formal complaint [7][8]. Businesses face heavy penalties for violations they could catch sooner. Hush Line provides a safe channel to surface and address issues early.

## Threat Model & Mitigations

- **Server Compromise**: End-to-end encryption, data encrypted at rest; no PII required.  
- **Network Observers**: TLS + Tor to hide metadata.  
- **Account Compromise**: Strong passwords, optional 2FA.  
- **Legal Pressure**: Minimal data retention, no logs of message origins.

## Case Illustrations

### Edward Snowden  
Used Tor/Tails but faced usability gaps when sharing his key with journalists [10][11].

### Chelsea Manning  
Caught through digital trails and informant channels despite technical precautions [13][14].

### Andrew Aude  
Implicated by employer‑managed device screenshots despite using Signal [15].

### John Barnett  
Filed through official channels and faced retaliation, illustrating non‑anonymous risk [16].
