## Step 1. Reading Messages Using Proton

The easiest way to use Hush Line is in conjunction with Proton Mail.  
When you set up your account, you had the option to either paste a PGP key into your Encryption settings or import a key directly from Proton’s keyserver. Once imported, be sure to enable notifications:

- **Include Message Content**  
- **Encrypt Message Body**

Any time you receive a new Hush Line message, the encrypted contents will forward to Proton, where your key already resides, and be automatically decrypted in your inbox.

## Step 2. Reading Messages In‑App Using Mailvelope

If you prefer to read messages directly in the Hush Line app, follow Option 2.2 in **Account Setup**. When you click **“Go to Message”** on a tip in your inbox, you’ll see a red Mailvelope seal. Each encrypted field will display its own seal; clicking any seal prompts you to enter the password you created when setting up your PGP key.
