Step 1. Reading Messages Using Proton

The easiest way to use Hush Line is in conjunction with Proton Mail.
When you set up your account, you had the option to either paste a PGP
key in to your encryption settings, or importing a key directly from
Proton's keyserver. Once importing your key, you should have set up
notifications. If you chose Include Message Content and
Encrypt Message Body any time you receive a new Hush Line message, the
encrypted contents will forward to Proton, where the key to decrypt the
message already exists, and will be automatically decrypted in your
inbox.

Step 2. Reading Messages In-App Using Mailvelope

If you want to read messages directly in the Hush Line app, you should
have followed Option 2.2 in the Account Setup section of Getting
Started. When you click "Go to Message" on a tip in your inbox, you
should see the red Mailvelope seal. Each field is encrypted
individually, so you should see multiple seals. When you click one of
the seals you'll be prompted to enter the password you created when
setting up your key.
