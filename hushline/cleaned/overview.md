# Hush Line Project Info

## Info

Hush Line is a free and open‑source, self‑hosted anonymous tip line that makes it easy for organizations or individuals to install and use. It's intended for journalists and newsrooms to offer a public tip line; by educators and school administrators to provide students with a safe way to report potentially sensitive information, or employers, board rooms, and C‑suites for anonymous employee reporting.

## Why Hush Line?

Other tools in this space include SecureDrop and GlobalLeaks, two robust, widely adopted whistleblowing platforms whose installation can be complicated for non-technical users. They often require special infrastructure, admin configuration, and significant time and money to manage—both for administrators and for whistleblowers.

In contrast, Hush Line is a text‑only, one‑way messenger that requires no PII, no new app downloads, and no PGP key management by the submitter. Deployable on clearnet or onion‑only, it encrypts each message with your public PGP key, sends it directly to your inbox, and never stores it unencrypted on the server.

We bundle hardened Nginx, automatic Let’s Encrypt renewals, privacy‑preserving logs (scrubbing IPs), and auto‑updates so you stay secure without lifting a finger. All you need is a public PGP key and an SMTP‑compatible email address.
