Prep Your Account

Let's get you set up! Hush Line works best as a background service-once
configured, we'll deliver messages to your inbox so you never have to
log back in.

Step 1. Add Information About Yourself

In Settings > Profile, add a clear bio, extra links, or your Signal
username to help your community.

Step 2. Enable End-to-End Encryption

Add an encryption key so you can receive messages securely. Let's start
from Settings > Encryption:

Option 2.1. Use with Proton Mail

Messages will be delivered to your Proton inbox and auto-decrypted. If
you don't have a Proton account, visit proton.me. From Settings >
Encryption > Proton Key Import, enter your Proton email and click the
Search Proton button.

Option 2.2. Use with Mailvelope

Prefer Gmail or no email forwarding? Use Mailvelope. After creating your
PGP keypair, export your public key and paste it into the text area
labeled "Or, Add Your Public PGP Key Manually." Finally, click "+
Authorize this domain" in the Mailvelope menu.

Step 3. Enable Message Forwarding

Forward messages so you don't have to log back in. For Proton Mail, use
your new Proton email. For Gmail users with Mailvelope, click the red
Mailvelope seal in your inbox and enter your key password.
