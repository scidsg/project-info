# Prep Your Account

Let's get you set up! Hush Line works best as a background service—once  
configured, we'll deliver messages to your inbox so you never have to  
log back in.

## Step 1. Add Information About Yourself

In **Settings > Profile**, add a clear bio, extra links, or your Signal  
username to help your community.

## Step 2. Enable End-to-End Encryption

Add an encryption key so you can receive messages securely. Let's start  
from **Settings > Encryption**:

### Option 2.1. Use with Proton Mail

Messages will be delivered to your Proton inbox and auto‑decrypted. If  
you don't have a Proton account, visit [proton.me](https://proton.me).  
From **Settings > Encryption > Proton Key Import**, enter your Proton  
email and click **Search Proton**.

### Option 2.2. Use with Mailvelope

Prefer Gmail or no email forwarding? Use Mailvelope. After creating your  
PGP keypair, export your public key and paste it into the text area  
labeled _“Or, Add Your Public PGP Key Manually.”_ Finally, click **+  
Authorize this domain** in the Mailvelope menu.

## Step 3. Enable Message Forwarding

Forward messages so you don't have to log back in. For Proton Mail, use  
your new Proton email. For Gmail users with Mailvelope, click the red  
Mailvelope seal in your inbox and enter your key password.
