# Start Here

Let’s get you set up! Hush Line works best as a background service—once  
configured, we’ll deliver messages to your inbox so you never have to  
log back in.

## Create a Hush Line Account

Hush Line does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to  
register a tip line. For extra privacy, use our Onion service.

1. **Create your account.** When complete, you'll be redirected to the login page.

**Congratulations!**
