Newsweek

"Investing in technology that protects privacy-such as Hush Line and
Signal-is also important in sharing information that is anonymous, and
can't be subpoenaed."

TIME

"Psst's safe is based on Hush Line, a tool designed by the nonprofit
Science & Design, Inc., as a simpler way for sources to reach out to
journalists and lawyers. It's a one-way conversation system, essentially
functioning as a tip-line. Micah Lee, an engineer on Hush Line, says
that the tool fills a gap in the market for an encrypted yet accessible
central clearinghouse for sensitive information."

"New systems in development, such as Hush Line, developed by
entrepreneur Glenn Sorrentino, are the brave new frontier in reporting.
Hush Line is a software application that offers a more secure ability to
report anonymously."

"I'm working with a a non-profit software company called Science and
Design that's worked on a number of really interesting products that are
kind of nerdy and more on the journalism space, but they're working on
something called Hush Line, which is a one-way encrypted anonymizing
platform so that whistleblowers can reach out to individual journalists
while remaining anonymous... it provides a non-technical person a way and
a path and information, should they find themselves in a whistleblowing
position, to not mitigate the danger because it's never not going to be
dangerous, but prepare them for the process and give them an easy-to-use
modern tool to responsibly disclose information to trustworthy
journalists..."
