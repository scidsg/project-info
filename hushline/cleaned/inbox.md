# Inbox

## Step 1. Inbox on the Desktop

When you start receiving Hush Line messages, your Inbox will help keep you organized. When you change the status of a message, you'll be able to quickly filter to see all messages with those statuses.

When using a desktop or laptop computer, your inbox tabs will display on the left side of the interface.
