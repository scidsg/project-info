## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>How anonymous is Hush Line?</summary>

Hush Line requires no personally identifying information (PII) for tip line owners to use the service, including an email address. We offer an Onion service for users with advanced privacy needs, accessible via Tor Browser, making connections fully anonymous. Message submitters may also use our Onion service without creating an account.

Onion addresses:  
- Clearnet: `j5kv55yiu3rneydqn4f35kyhejbq3fhkkm7glg5nbtvxgaxthou7g2ad.onion`  
- App: `hyewn4dvbedq7ooe3oxrhpceljd7ncfyeyts2c7nwsjp34i46smbzwid.onion`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is Hush Line end‑to‑end encrypted?</summary>

Yes! Hush Line uses OpenPGP.js for client‑side encryption, giving users who add their public PGP key end‑to‑end encryption. Users who disable JavaScript use server‑side encryption. Data in transit is protected by TLS; data at rest is encrypted.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is two‑way communication available?</summary>

Submitters may include a contact method or create a Hush Line account to continue a conversation. We recommend both parties upload public PGP keys for full encryption.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I be deanonymized?</summary>

No technology is a silver bullet. We scrub IPs and offer Tor, but operational security matters. For high‑risk cases, consider Tails/Qubes with Whonix on an uncompromised burner device.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why not just use Signal?</summary>

Signal requires a download and valid phone number. Hush Line is web‑based, no app or account needed, removing barriers for whistleblowers.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is Hush Line different from SecureDrop?</summary>

SecureDrop is an on‑prem, multi‑server setup optimized for file handling. Hush Line is a hosted, text‑only service with managed infrastructure and email delivery, ideal for teams without a dedicated operations staff.
