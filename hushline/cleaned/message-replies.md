A PGP key must be uploaded to use this feature. See Step 4 in Getting Started.

### Step 1. Set Custom Replies

Customize automatic responses when a tip is received (e.g., `? Declined`) to include additional contact details.

### Step 2. A Good Accept Message

An example of a good acceptance message includes clear next steps for your source to contact you. We recommend using Signal for two‑way communication.

[Accepted Message Example]

> Thank you for contacting me! I'd like to speak directly to you at your earliest  
> convenience. Please download Signal from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669)  
> or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms),  
> then contact me with the username `@myusername.01`.

### Step 3. What a Whistleblower Sees

When someone submits a message to you, they’ll receive a unique URL only known to them. When you update the status of a message in your inbox, the message on that page will update.
